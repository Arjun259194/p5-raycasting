# raycasting P5

This is a small recreation of raycasiting in P5

## How to run on your local machine?

clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Arjun259194/p5-raycasting
```
Move to the directory
```
cd p5-raycasting
```

> Make sure you have `node` and `npm` in your machine

Serve the `index.html` with your choice. I used `live-server`.
```
npx live-server .
```

The server will start in post `8080` by default. so go to `http://localhost:8080`.
